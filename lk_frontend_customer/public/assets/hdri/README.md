# HDR Environment Files

To enable advanced lighting and reflections in the 3D viewer, place HDR files here.

## Required File
- `studio_small_03_1k.hdr` - Studio environment lighting

## Where to get HDR files:
1. **Poly Haven** (free): https://polyhaven.com/hdris
2. **HDRI Haven** (free): https://hdrihaven.com/
3. Download any 1K or 2K studio/indoor HDR file
4. Rename it to `studio_small_03_1k.hdr`
5. Place it in this directory

## Note:
If no HDR file is present, the 3D viewer will use basic lighting instead.
